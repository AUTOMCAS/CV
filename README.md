I enjoyed a career in Engineering Education for 7 years before learning to become a software developer at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I have always lived to discover, to learn, to overcome, to build and to solve problems. I found the same satisfaction with software development but with the extra advantages that its digital nature enables. Rapid access to information, tools and solutions. An environment made for iteration, to be able to test, experiment, and rapidly improve a project.

I love to:

- Discover why and how something works.
- Learn how to more effectively learn.
- Apply skills and knowledge to problem solve.
- Help others learn.

## <a name="learning">Learning Journey</a>

I recorded my my learning journey through Makers Academy on my way to becoming a Software Developer [here](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey)

[Strategies](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey/blob/main/learning_strategies/methods_for_effective_learning.md) included:

- Review and reflection.
- Celebrating challenges.
- Identifying learning objectives and asking questions.
- Diagrams.
- Having good routines.

## <a name="makers">Makers Academy experience</a>

August to December 2022.  
A highly selective 16 week intensive software development bootcamp.

- Learning how to better learn: developed and refined learning strategies using books, repetition and reflection. I recorded in my learning journey [here](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey).
- Adaptability: Learning new Languages, ways of working and technologies in short periods of time.
- Clean code: Learning about and applying SOLID and OOP principles to develop projects with clean and easily adaptable code. Example: [Bank App tech test](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/bank_tech_test)
- TDD: Building projects using a red, green, refactor test driven processes. Ensuring good code coverage and behaviour first unit and integration tests.
- Debugging: Using error messages and logs/prints to gain visibility on issues.
- Full stack: Developing projects with front and back ends using a range of appropriate software. Example MERN stack: [GrumbleBook - A Facebook clone](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/grumbleBook)
- Databases: Using PostgreSQL and MongoDB to manage databases using create, read, update and delete operations.
- APIs: Using APIs like REST APIs to transfer data using functions like GET, POST and PATCH. The [Votewatch](https://github.com/tomallens/votewatch) project uses the external House of Commons API to obtain information on MPs
- Wellbeing, productivity and empathy: Practiced appropriate break taking and time management, alone and when part of a group or pair. Through my patience and integrity I endeavoured to create a feeling of safety in a learning environment where feedback can be freely given and received.
- Agile workflow: Following Agile project development processes to build projects as part of a team. Utilising planning sessions, ticketing, standups, sprints, retros and iterative development.
- Collaboration: Pairing daily over challenging material with people with a range of personalities and ways of working. Working closely with a team to develop projects with multiple features, technologies and short deadlines.

## <a name="skills">Skills and Knowledge</a>

**Dedicated to learning**

- I think learning and self development is one of the most important things in life. I have always enjoyed finding out about things and how they work and applying this practically.
- I enjoy sharing my knowledge and strategies with others. I get great satisfaction from helping others learn new things,
- I recorded some of my experiences in my Makers learning journey [here](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey).

**Plays well with others**

- I have always enjoyed working with curious, intelligent and knowledgeable people to solve problems.
- Within a team I am equally happy working independently on a specific task or working closely with others to solve larger issues.
- In my previous role and during group projects I find I often naturally fall into a position of leadership, planning and decision making.
- As a senior Engineering technician I worked closely with a number of junior technicians, students and staff with a wide range of ages, backgrounds and abilities.
- During group projects at Makers Academy I thoroughly enjoyed learning about and employing Agile methodologies. I found the iterative cycle of planning, implementation and reflection close to principles employed in engineering design and hugely beneficial to project development and enjoyment.

**Management and organisation**

- I value good planning, organisation and structure.
- I have led the design and planning of small and large projects, the largest being the redesign of an entire engineering department of 3 workshops, a computing suite and 3 support rooms.
- Within a team or when working alone I enjoy creating diagrams and other supporting documents to help both in planning and as a communication aid. Planning diagrams: [Bowling challenge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTOMCAS/bowling-challenge/main/bowling-js-diagram.png), [Bank tech test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTOMCAS/bank_tech_test/main/diagram.png)
- The TDD process and Object Orientated Programming fits right into my working ethos of systematic, clean and clear way of working through projects.

**Problem solving and attention to detail**

- Coming from an engineering background I am well practiced with breaking a problem down to its core components and applying a wide and deep understanding to solve each problem in turn.
- As a software developer my problem solving ability has increased greatly though continuous self reflection and learning new techniques such as TDD.

## <a name="hobbies">Hobbies with benefits</a>

I am a firm believer that while playing video games may seem like just having fun, they have helped me develop and fortify a range of skills, and not just the ability to click fast. My first and some of my best experiences of collaboration have been through video games. Working together to achieve a common goal over hours and days of planning, experimenting, building, testing and improving.

The fantastic challenges of building a spaceship in a game called Space Engineers;

- A spaceship has requirements and follows rules, how many engines will be needed, based on its weight?
- A spaceship is complex(potentially thousands of components), how will you break the problem down to solve smaller problems without losing sight of the end goal?
- Each component must be placed one by one, how will you plan ahead and constantly consider the bigger picture?
- Two or more people are working on this ship, how do you communicate your ideas and vision and collaborate so it all comes together? What happens when you disagree?
- There are always challenges to overcome, some expected and some surprises, how do you solve these with the given tools and components?
- How do you know what works? Being able to build parts in isolation, rapidly test and reconfigure leads to innovation and success.

In contrast to being absorbed by the world behind a screen, I very much love the natural world. I find it fascinating and could (and do) spend hours observing behaviors, noises, movement and appearance of plants and animals. I find it very meditative, great for my wellbeing and satisfies a deep curiosity for discovery.
