## Chris Aston: Under Development

[A record of my learning journey](https://github.com/AUTOMCAS/learning_journey)
#### A good person?

I enjoyed a career in Engineering Education for 7 years (but/and) I have always lived to discover, to learn, to overcome, to build and to solve problems. I found the same satisfaction with software development but with the extra advantages that its digital nature enables. Rapid access to information, tools and solutions. An environment made for iteration, to be able to test, experiment, and rapidly improve a project.

I love to:
- Learn and discover why and how something works.
- Learn how to learn
- Apply skills and knowledge learned to problem solve.
- Help others learn

Part about my software development development, skills, knowledge etc.  :')

#### Hobbies with benefits
I am a firm believer that while playing video games may seem like just having fun, they have helped me develop and fortify a range of skills, and not just the ability to click fast. My first and longest experiences of pairing with someone(to date) have been through video games. Working together to achieve a common goal over hours and days of planning, experimenting, building, testing and improving.

The fantastic challenges of building a spaceship in a game called Space Engineers;
- A spaceship has requirements and follows rules, how many engines will be needed, based on its weight?
- A spaceship is complex(potentially thousands of components), how will you break the problem down to solve smaller problems without losing sight of the end goal?
- Each component must be placed one by one, how will you plan ahead and constantly consider the bigger picture?
- Two or more people are working on this ship, how do you communicate your ideas and vision and collaborate so it all comes together? What happens when you disagree?
- There are always challenges to overcome, some expected and some surprises, how do you solve these with the given tools and components?
- How do you know what works? Being able to build parts in isolation, rapidly test and reconfigure leads to innovation and success.


In contrast to being absorbed by the world behind a screen, I very much love the natural world. I find it fascinating and could (and do) spend hours observing behaviors, noises, movement and appearance of plants and animals. I find it very meditative, great for my well being and satisfies a deep curiosity for discovery.


## Know-how (or Skills and Knowledge)



#### Beneficial skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
