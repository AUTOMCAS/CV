#### Hobbies with benefits
I am a firm believer that while playing video games may seem like just having fun, they have helped me develop and fortify a range of skills, and not just the ability to click fast. 

The challenges of building a simple spaceship in a game called Space Engineers (some ships can be thousands of components)
-A spaceship has requirements and follows rules, where will fuel be stored? How many engines will be needed, based on its weight?
-A spaceship is complex, how will you break the problem down to solve smaller problems without loosing sight of the end goal?
-Each component must be placed one by one, How will you have plan ahead and constantly consider the bigger picture?
-Two or more people are working on this ship at one time, how do you communicate your ideas and vision and collaborate so it all comes together? What happens when you disagree?
-There are always challenges to overcome, some expected and some suprises. How do you solve these with the given tools and components?
-How do you know what works? Being able to build parts in isolation, rapidly test and reconfigure leads to innovation and success.

Could emphesise the soft skills?
My first and longest experience of pairing withsomeone to achieve a common goal over hours and days of planning, experimenting, building, testing and improving. 

In contrast to being absorbed by the world behind a screen, I very much love the natural world. I find it fascinating and could (and do) spend hours observing behaviours, noises, movement and appearance of plants and animals. I find it very medititve and satisfies a deep curiosity for discovery.



A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.


## Know-how (or Skills and Knowledge)

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)


## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Final project**            | A webapp to do x. | React, Jest, etc. |
| **Something else worked on** | A webapp to do y. | Ruby              |



## Work Experience

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience relevent to software development


## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person
